Prerequisites

Azure AD Application: Ensure you have registered an application in Azure AD and have the Client ID, Client Secret, and Tenant ID.

Certificates: You need client and server certificates for mTLS.

Steps to Request a JWT Token with mTLS

- Register an Application in Azure AD:

    Register your application in Azure AD and configure it to use client certificates for authentication.

- Generate and Upload Certificates:
    
    Generate a client certificate and upload it to your Azure AD application under the Certificates & secrets section.

- Request an Access Token:

    Use the following curl command to request an access token from Azure AD with mTLS:

        curl -X POST \
        -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
        --cert client-cert.pem \
        --key client-key.pem \
        -d "grant_type=client_credentials&client_id=<YOUR_CLIENT_ID>&client_secret=<YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET>&scope=https%3A%2F%2Fgraph.microsoft.com%2F.default" \
        https://login.microsoftonline.com/<YOUR_TENANT_ID>/oauth2/v2.0/token

        Example Breakdown:
        grant_type: Specifies the OAuth 2.0 grant type. For client credentials flow, use client_credentials.
        client_id: The Application (client) ID of your registered Azure AD application.
        client_secret: The client secret generated for your application.
        scope: The scope of the access request. Use https://yourapiuri/.default.
        URL: The token endpoint URL for your Azure AD tenant.
        –cert: Path to the client certificate file.
        –key: Path to the client certificate private key file.

Token request URL example: https://login.microsoftonline.com/<YOUR_TENANT_ID>/oauth2/v2.0/token

Example Response:
If the request is successful, you will receive a JSON response containing the access token:

```JSON

{
  "token_type": "Bearer",
  "expires_in": 3600,
  "ext_expires_in": 3600,
  "access_token": "eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsImtpZCI6..."
}
```
You can then use this access token to authenticate API requests by including it in the Authorization header:

    curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN>" https://yourapi.com/v1.0/resource
